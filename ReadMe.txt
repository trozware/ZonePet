ZonePet add-on for World of Warcraft
====================================

Keeps a pet active at all times, using a pet native to the current zone if possible.
Will not change more than once every 5 minutes, unless you go to a completely new zone
    or you lose your pet due to flying.
If you do not have any pets from a zone or only a few, you will get a random pet instead.

v 1.3.0: Now with a minimap button. Mouse over the button for help.
v 1.2.0: Will not summon a pet if you are stealthed. In PvP mode, will dismiss a pet when you stealth.
