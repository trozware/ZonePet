# ZonePet

## Add-on for World of Warcraft

---

Available from [CurseForge](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/zonepet)

**ZonePet** keeps a companion pet active, preferably with a pet from the zone you are in.

You may have collected hundreds of pets, but you never remember to summon them so you are missing out on some fun content. And when you do summon, you always summon from among the same few, or maybe that pet just doesn't fit in.

**ZonePet** checks all your pets and tries to summon a pet that is native to your current zone.
If you have no pets or only a few pets from the zone, you may see a random pet instead.

### Usage

Install the add-on and when you log in, you will summon a pet automatically. Whenever you enter a new zone, land from a flight or after 5 minutes with the same pet, a different pet will be summoned.

Read the pet's name and description in the Chat window - the descriptions can be very funny - yet another way we are missing out on some good content.

Bonus for sneaky types: no pet will be summoned while you are in Stealth mode and if you enter Stealth mode and are flagged for PvP, your pet will be dismissed so as not to attract unwanted attention.

### MiniMap button

Mouse over the MiniMap button to see details about your currently summoned pet (if any) and to operate the ZonePet add-on.

- Left-click - change to a different pet.
- Right-click - dismiss your pet (you will not get a new one until you left-click or use '/zp new').
- Shift + Left-click - switch between summoning favorite pets only or using all your pets.
- Shift + Right-click - hide the MiniMap button (use the /zp commands to operate **ZonePet** or to bring back the button).

### Slash Commands

- /zp new - change to a different pet.
- /zp dismiss - dismiss your pet (you will get a new one when you change zone).
- /zp fav - summon favorite pets only (if you have enough).
- /zp all - choose from all your pets.
- /zp mini - show the MiniMap button if you have hidden it.

If /zp conflicts with any other commands, use /zonepet instead.
