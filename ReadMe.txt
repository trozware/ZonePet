ZonePet add-on for World of Warcraft
====================================

Keeps a pet active at all times, using a pet native to the current zone if possible.
Will not change more than once every 5 minutes, unless you lose your pet.
If you do not have any pets from a zone or only a few, you will get a random pet instead.

v 1.4.8: Updated for Patch 8.2.
v 1.4.7: 
  Type '/zp dupe' in chat to list your duplicate pets.
